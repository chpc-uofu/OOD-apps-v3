An interactive app designed for Open OnDemand that launches a Jupyter
server on a CHPC infrastructure.

CHPC modifications include local cluster and Linux host adapter settings, choice of Jupyter Notebook or Lab, and custom Python environment entry.

Most content below is from the original [OSC app](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter).

## Prerequisites

This Batch Connect app requires the following software be installed on the
**compute nodes** that the batch job is intended to run on (**NOT** the
OnDemand node):

- [Lmod] 6.0.1+ or any other `module purge` and `module load <modules>` based
  CLI used to load appropriate environments within the batch job before
  launching the Jupyter server.
- [Jupyter] 4.2.3+ (earlier versions are untested but may work for
  you)
- [OpenSSL] 1.0.1+ (used to hash the Jupyter server password)

## Install

Use Git to clone this app and checkout the desired branch/version you want to
use:

```sh
scl enable git19 -- git clone <repo>
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

You will not need to do anything beyond this as all necessary assets are
installed. You will also not need to restart this app as it isn't a Passenger
app.

To update the app you would:

```sh
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git fetch
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

Again, you do not need to restart the app as it isn't a Passenger app.
